<h4> Let's learn about taxes: </h4>
<h5> Tax Availability </h5>
<p> Your tax documents are available in mid-February following each year you have sold stock or received at least $10 in dividends. You won’t receive a tax document if you only purchased stock.

Ex: If you sold stocks or received at least $10 in dividends in 2016, your tax documents would be available in mid-February of 2017.

We pass along a consolidated 1099 generated by our clearing partner, which includes information found on the 1099-DIV and 1099-B. If you aren’t sure how to file a consolidated 1099 or want a different form, then we recommend speaking to a tax advisor. </p>

<h5> Missing/Incorrect Cost Basis </h5>
<p>
In some occasions, the cost basis generated on your 1099 might be incorrect. This can happen for a variety of reasons, such as a corporate action, reverse stock split, or wash sale. If this happens to you, reach out to us at support@StockMock.com to request an Excel file of your entire trading history from which you can calculate your correct cost basis.
